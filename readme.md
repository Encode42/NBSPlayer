# NBSPlayer
A simple `.nbs` file player for your browser.

Supports all NBS file versions via [NBS.js]!

### Why?
This repository exists as a high-performance NBS player, as well as an example of how to use NBS.js.

The demo page for [NBS.js][NBS.js Demo] is far too complex to be understood by the masses, as it contains statistics, editors, and other over-complicated aspects.
I decided to extract the player portion of the page to ensure it could be easily understood.
